### About RISE V2G

RISE V2G is a **R**eference **I**mplementation **S**upporting the **E**volution of the **V**ehicle-**2**-**G**rid communication interface ISO/IEC 15118.
The international standard ISO/IEC 15118, entitled "Road vehicles - Vehicle to grid communication interface", defines a digital IP-based communication interface between an electric vehicle (EV) and a charging station (named Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment - EVSE). It allows for a user-friendly "plug-and-charge" mechanism for authentication, authorisation, billing, and flexible load control based on a wide set of information exchanged between the EV and EVSE.
A rise in the wide application of this standard is essential for reaching the goal of integrating EVs as flexible energy storage devices into a smart grid.


### Mission Statement
The RISE V2G project shall serve as an open source standard-compliant reference implementation and documentation. As such, the objective is to provide a test platform for interoperability testing and to offer an information resource for interested parties. The adoption of a new technology heavily depends on the interoperability of its various implementations. The more tests conducted, the more stable and reliable the developed solution will be.

As the ISO/IEC 15118 consists of eight documment parts - with part 1 to 3 defining use cases and requirements for conductive charging, parts 4 and 5 dealing with conformance tests, and parts 6 to 8 specifying use cases and requirements for inductive charging - the RISE V2G project shall evolve to cover all aspects of conductive and inductive charging from the physical layer up to the application layer. However, it requires a lot of work to be done to fulfil this endeavor.
Your assistance would therefore be very appreciated, be it by testing this reference implementation against your own solution - this way uncovering possible bugs or making code optimisation suggestions - or by providing an implementation for yet missing parts.
